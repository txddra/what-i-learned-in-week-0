# What-I-Learned-In-Week-0
---
### In week 0, I learned a plethora of things such as:
*  how to set up a work space.
*  practice using the terminal.
*  command short cuts
*  file paths  
*  learned terminal commands and arguments
*  learned how to use visual studio code
*  learned about what github was, and how to use it
*  practiced adding, committing, and pushing things in the terminal to have it update in github.


One of the things I'm really proud of learning was how to add, commit & push:

1. is to make sure that you're in the directory of what you're going to be pushing.
2. is to give the commands that are necessary: **git add** usually to the `readme.md`
3. is to **git commit** then add "-m" and what was the latest update made ie: "added a picture"
4. then you **git push** that will complete the command.
